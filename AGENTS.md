# AGENTS

Any game logic or tests in this repository must prefer modules provided by `libft` over the C++ standard library whenever a similar feature exists. Use libft types and functions such as `ft_string`, `ft_thread`, `ft_this_thread_*`, `ft_to_string`, `ft_strcmp`, and time helpers instead of their standard library counterparts.
