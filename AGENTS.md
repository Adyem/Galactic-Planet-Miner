# AGENTS

Any game logic or tests in this repository must prefer modules provided by `libft` over the C++ standard library whenever a similar feature exists. Use libft types and functions such as `ft_string`, `ft_thread`, `ft_this_thread_*`, `ft_to_string`, `ft_strcmp`, and time helpers instead of their standard library counterparts.

Keep `test_failures.log` under version control so that failure histories with timestamps remain available for debugging. When updating the file, remove entries for issues that are no longer present so the log reflects only outstanding problems.
